title: "Technology and society go hand in hand."
---
The present technological context is rapidly transforming the way we communicate and coordinate as a species, allowing us to bypass all kinds of physical, geographical or political conditions.

We are part of a global network, mediated through devices that model our behavior, at the same time that our actions and reactions shape the tools that constitute the network itself.

**Technology and society are intertwined in a fabric of compromises and dependencies that makes it impossible to understand them separately. They are both cause and effect, one of the other.**
