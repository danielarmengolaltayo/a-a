Two spaces of identical dimensions. One, inhabited by the artist, equipped with a controller and a virtual reality headset. The second has a controller on the floor, waiting for someone to take it. When visitors grab the controller and move it, they also move the controller that the artist had in his hand, giving the illusion of being able to control the artist's movements, as if he were a human puppet.
