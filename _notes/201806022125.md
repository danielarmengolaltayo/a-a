>"We live in a world where there is more and more information, and less and less meaning."
>*— Jean Baudrillard*

“He is best known for his analyses of media, contemporary culture, and technological communication, as well as his formulation of concepts such as simulation and hyperreality.”

“Hyperreality is an inability of consciousness to distinguish reality from a simulation of reality, especially in technologically advanced postmodern societies. Hyperreality is seen as a condition in which what is real and what is fiction are seamlessly blended together so that there is no clear distinction between where one ends and the other begins.”

(excerpts from Wikipedia: Jean Baudrillard, hyperreality)
