>Sapiens  
>by Yuval Noah Harari

During the performance "Follow" I was listening to a wide variety of music, from techno to opera, and also podcasts and books about the history and future of humankind, technology, spirituality, human relationships and altered states of consciousness. I had around 300 hours to nurture my ears.

Sapiens was one of the books I consumed during this time.

Listening to it, I realized the little interest I had during school about history, in general, and I thought that this book should be an essential teaching tool for any history class, for how well explained everything it is inside the book, and at the same time, for how well narrated the book is, in a way that engages really well with the reader.

When I finished the book and I got this overview picture of how we, as species, got here, my mind did a click forward. It is one of this physically big and intimidating books, but If you do the exercise of not worrying too much for its length and just focus on enjoying its content, I can assure you an intense and beautiful trip. A must read.

I previously watched some talks of Yuval, and I get attracted instantly by his oratory.
