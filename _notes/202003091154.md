**The Internet is not the same as the Web.**

It is very common to use the terms of the Internet and the Web [as synonyms](202003091226) without caring too much about the differences or the exact meaning. Depending on the context itâ€™s not a big deal, but because with this text I want you to pay attention particularly to one of them, the Web, I am going to go over the main differences really fast to be sure we are in the same page before we explore the topic further.

- [The Internet is infrastructure](202003091227), more specifically, information infrastructure. The Web is a system running on top of this infrastructure, like the email, for example.
- We use the Internet with the objective to improve communication between humans and we use [the Web as a non-physical place where we actually meet to communicate and coordinate with others](202003091228).
- The Internet links physical devices worldwide, **the Web connects pieces of information with other pieces of information**.
