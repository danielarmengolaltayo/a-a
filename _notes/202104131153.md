As smart devices and social networks entered our lives, hyper-connectivity has made our world move faster than ever, with technology shaping the way we relate to other human beings, creating new languages and shaping our behaviors through small gestures and everyday habits.

The selfie phenomenon is a clear example of a gesture that every internet social being has adopted due to the mobile devices and social mediaâ€™s way of working, and its impact on society has been extremely high.

# On one hand, we teach machines to understand us, giving them the ability to replicate gestures and habits in a surprisingly human way. On the other hand, as we all seem to repeat the same behaviors with a given technology, we ourselves start acting as predictable machines.
