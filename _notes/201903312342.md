>Do you feel blocked too?

Do you remember [#daa_38]([[201903292339]]) ?

There is a wall blocking the road we are running.  
There is a wall blocking our road. There is an obstacle in our way.

How far is it? How long to get there?

An obstacle. An impediment in our journey.

Our journey to where? Where are we going?  
And why are we running in the first place?  

Stop, wait.

Running, but how fast?  
Why are we in such a hurry?  
Can we walk? Can we slow down?  
Do we have a moment to stop and breathe?  
Breathe for a moment, because, how much time‚Ä¶ since when are we running?

Hold on.

We are. We are with other people.  
Running the same road, towards the same wall.

Who are they? Do I know them? Do they know me?  
Did we ever talk? Did I ever try to listen to them, to really listen to at least one of them?  
What does she feels? What are his fears? Are they preocupied about the wall?

Oh yes, fuck, don‚Äôt forget the wall.  
Somebody said that there is a wall.

Who said that? Can I trust that person?  
Can I see the wall with my own eyes? How is it? How does it looks like?

The wall, this wall, my wall.

What does it mean to me?  
Why is it blocking me?

Do I have any option? Do I have more options?  
What am I gonna do if the rest choose to do the same, but different from what I would like to do?

Maybe there is something already blocking me, and I didn‚Äôt reach the wall yet.  
Maybe I am thinking too much, asking too much.

Maybe we are running too much.
