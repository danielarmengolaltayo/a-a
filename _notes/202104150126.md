title: "I am a strange loop / Instruments for introspection"
---
A mirror mirroring a mirror. A selfie as a projection of the self. Artificial intelligence proficient at recognizing its surroundings, capable of learning and even dreaming. Psychedelia.

**An interface, deeply immersed in self-observation, lost in an apparent spiral of vanity, posing and taking selfies endlessly, trapped into a strange loop of technological introspection**. A visual loop that we can intervene to become part of an altered state in search of consciousness and the meaning of the self.
