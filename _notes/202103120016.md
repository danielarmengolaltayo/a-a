**Hello!**

My name is [Daniel Armengol Altay√≥]([[202103120055]]), and this is an experiment where I am sharing [my research notes]([[202103120337]]), as a complement to [my artistic practice](https://armengol-altayo.com/). 

I am here to participate in the conception and creation of alternatives to the current digital paradigm. My hypothesis is that by having more clarity on how digital information operates and how we relate to it, we can coordinate efforts more effectively towards common goals. I want to put this idea to test, and eventually, transform it into something tangible that can be of benefit to everyone.


At some point in the future, I might use [this mailing list](https://newsletter.vewpoint.com/subscribe) for sporadic updates, but in the meantime, if you are interested in any of the topics covered here, [say hi](mailto:hello@vewpoint.com?subject=Hi Daniel!), I'd love to talk with you!
