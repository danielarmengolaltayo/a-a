# 2013 → 2018

We close the studio and I progressively leave commercial work behind. I continue to explore the role that technology plays in our lives and how we use it to relate to others, paying special attention to the gestures that emerge from the interactions with and through technology. During that time I learn about prototyping and digital fabrication, and integrate these new skills into my artistic practice.
