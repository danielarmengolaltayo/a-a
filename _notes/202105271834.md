[Pointless](202104111309), 2021

We live in times dominated by a new medium that demands new forms of interaction and communication. A medium that imposes such accelerated rhythms that it hardly leaves us room to breathe, digest or reflect. It seems, that in this scenario, absurdity has become the maxim that moves us, and that only those who take it to the extreme, attracting the greatest number of looks and ears to their discourses, will have the opportunity to influence the behavior of the social body.

This was my proposal of extreme absurdity: [I tried to capture my full attention by following random instructions every second, for 24 hours](202105291521). **Because, if attention is a limited resource that can be exploited, where exactly is its limit?**
 
Attention has become a valuable asset because it can be captured, measured, and profiled, and then used to target and trigger specific behaviors in us. I harvested my own attention, so [you can buy it](202105271855), in an alluring show designed to grab yours, with the final goal of being able to ask you a question: 

# Do you think it is possible to regain some agency over the flows of our own attention?
