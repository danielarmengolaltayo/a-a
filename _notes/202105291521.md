>â†‘ Watch the video on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRdb935v1sQ).

**[My task]([[202105291101]]) consisted of following 86400 one-bit instructions, randomly generated by a computer at the speed of one instruction per second.**

Using a marker on a sheet of paper, I had to paint or not, according to the orders emitted by the computer (yes or no), stopping as little as possible, for the time strictly necessary.

If I lost my attention during the process, I had to stop the instructions, paint using a red marker, and when I was ready to continue, start the instructions again.

[At one instruction per second]([[202105311723]]), [one sheet would be the theoretical equivalent of one hour]([[202105291511]]). [24 sheets]([[202105271855]]) would be [the theoretical equivalent]([[202105291803]]) of 86400 instructions. 

[The performance]([[202104111309]]) is presented as [an experiment to test the limits of my own attention]([[202105291750]]). The absurdity of the proposal, its design as a challenge, the narrative and the visual language chosen for the video, all combined, act as a playground to explore our understanding of human attention, its value and the role it plays in our current digital society.
