[Pointless](202104111309), 2021

# My task consisted of following 86400 one-bit instructions, randomly generated by a computer at the speed of one instruction per second.

[Using a marker on a sheet of paper](202105291101), I had to paint or not, according to the orders emitted by the computer (yes or no), stopping as little as possible, for the time strictly necessary.

If I lost my attention during the process, I had to stop the instructions, paint using a red marker, and when I was ready to continue, start the instructions again.

[At one instruction per second](202105311723), [one sheet would be the theoretical equivalent of one hour](202105291511). [24 sheets](202105271855) would be [the theoretical equivalent](202105291803) of 86400 instructions. 

The performance is presented as [an experiment to test the limits of my own attention](202105291750). The absurdity of the proposal, its design as a challenge, the narrative and the visual language chosen for the video, all combined, act as a playground to explore our understanding of human attention, its value and the role it plays in our current digital society.
