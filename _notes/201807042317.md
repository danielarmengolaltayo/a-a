>Vipassana, Reality, Suffering & Consciousness  
>Interview to Yuval Noah Harari

I met @stuartmauck the tenth and last day of the vipassana course. He pointed out to this interview of Yuval Noah Harari where he talks about the technique we just learnt and his experience with it. I have to admit that at that moment I didn't expect him, with such a rational mind, to have an spiritual side.

Now it makes more sense.

Prejudices. Wrong labeling inside my head. Wrong. Just labeling.
