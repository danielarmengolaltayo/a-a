**We are information processing machines.** We perceive reality through our senses and transform it into a conception of the world that is useful to us for our survival. We collect information, process it, and act on it. That is why information technologies play a key role in our evolution as a species.

The possibility of managing information differently influences the configuration of our mental models, affecting our behaviors, our way of interacting with our surroundings, how we generate new information, and ultimately altering the balance points of a network of interdependencies, a network formed by all the entities that coexist on this planet.
