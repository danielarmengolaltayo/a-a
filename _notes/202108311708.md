> The templates for digital knowledge gardens are very close to my needs, but the intention of any template is that you can focus on the content rather than how to display it, and in my case, I also want to have the possibility to explore different ways of displaying the same set of notes. That's why my intention is to migrate from Ruby to Js at some point, to facilitate the production of future visualizations.
