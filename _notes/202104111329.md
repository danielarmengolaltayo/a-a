title: "Follow / Who designs your behavior?"
---
We live together in a beautiful but unbalanced world, where the fears and interests of some, design the behaviors of many.

This relationship of power applies in any social interaction; we are constantly being influenced by the thoughts and actions of the others, and vice versa, molding the persona, hence the entire social fabric. Sometimes this happens naturally, free of intention, sometimes there is a hidden agenda behind, and not always is easy to identify [who controls whom]([[202103150141]]).

**Are you able to recognize the tools and strategies used to create, modify or determine behavior? Do you act responsibly when using them on another human being?**

>"Behavior and perception can also be designed. This is not only designâ€™s great power, but also its great responsibility." *Excerpt from the texts used in the exhibition.*
