>Do you really know why you do what you do?  
>16:10 min talk by Petter Johansson

Highlights from the talk:

“I’m an experimental psychologist, and […] we wanted to create an experiment that would allow us to challenge what people say about themselves, regardless of how certain they may seem.

[…] a method in which we would be able to manipulate the outcome of people's choices. This way we would know when people are wrong about themselves, even if they don't know this themselves.

[…] the strong conclusion to draw from this is that if there are no differences between a real choice and a manipulated choice, perhaps we make things up all the time.

[…] a lot of what we call self-knowledge is actually self-interpretation. So I see myself make a choice, and then when I'm asked why, I just try to make as much sense of it as possible when I make an explanation. But we do this so quickly and with such ease that we think we actually know the answer when we answer why.

[…] know that you don't know yourself. Or at least not as well as you think you do.”
