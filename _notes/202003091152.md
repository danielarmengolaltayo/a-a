**The Internet is a living collective portrait of humanity.**

We can see on the Internet who we are and even how we get here, and paying a little bit more of attention, we can also see through the Internet the vast potential we have as a species. This is because the Internet is not only a product resulting from our past actions, but also guides us and provides the necessary opportunities for our future behavior to emerge.

Technology and society cannot be understood separately. They both constantly influence each other, co-evolving together as a whole.

[As John M. Culkin said when presenting Marshall McLuhan’s ideas](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2016/06/26/shape/), “we shape our tools and thereafter our tools shape us”.
