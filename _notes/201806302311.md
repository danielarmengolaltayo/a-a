Nice timing for watching this documentary, if you take into account that I've been controlled for one month and a half in my latest artwork and that I am just back after an intense ten-days meditation course. Incredible story and beautifully narrated.

Some random thoughts.

Know yourself and act accordingly. Do not ignore your weaknesses or fears, work hard to overcome them. Understand what triggers your behaviours to be in control over your actions. Be humble when exploiting the full potential of your strengths. Love yourself and others in equal parts.

Perception of reality is subjective and any meaning will be lost in the act of communication. Collect information (different sources, different points of view), process it and construct your own opinion. You are the only one responsible of creating your reality. If you donâ€™t do that, others will.

Do not follow blindly. Get inspired. Inspire others.
