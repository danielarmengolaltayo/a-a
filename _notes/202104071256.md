This is my video bio, divided by chapters.

[**2008 → 2013**](202104081542)  
The wonders of human behavior.  

[**2013 → 2018**](202104081543)  
How do we relate to technology and through it, to others?  

[**2018**](202104081544)  
Technological devices and digital tools have a huge influence power on the development and consolidation of our behavior.  

**2018 → 20??**  
In a process of digesting the experiences of 2018, I decide to invest some time to strengthen my coding skills and I move my focus to research: what is information, how it behaves in a digital context, and why these questions are relevant for us as a society.
